// This is a placeholder for your models. Each model should be a class that represents a specific database table.
// You should export each model from this file for use in your application.

// Here's an example of what a model might look like:

/*
class User {
  constructor(public id: number, public name: string, public email: string) {}

  // Add methods for retrieving and manipulating data here
}

export { User };
*/

// Note: You'll need to replace the above example with your actual models.
